# sidecar-search

A set of CLI build tools for sidecar indexes to add semantic search to anything. Originally cleaved off from [abstracts-search](https://github.com/colonelwatch/abstracts-search) and made generic. Code is WIP. Documentation is WIP.

## Development

A `conda` environment YAML, containing module dependencies and developer utilities, is provided. Setup is with the following commands:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sidecar-search-dev
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```
